                    <h1 class="mainheading">Project Overview</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">The MESCE UAE Alumni app is an exclusive platform designed specifically for the alumni of MES College of Engineering, Kuttipuram, providing a Job Vacancy Hub where members can explore career opportunities shared by fellow alumni or companies, with filters for industry, location, and role to find relevant openings. It also includes a Blood Donor Network, allowing users to quickly locate registered alumni by blood group in emergencies fostering both career growth and a supportive, connected community.</p>

                    <h1 class="mainheading">My Role</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">My role in the MESCE UAE Alumni app project covered end-to-end UX design, starting with in-depth research, including field studies, user interactions, and stakeholder interviews to uncover key needs and pain points. I conducted secondary research on platforms like Naukrigulf, LinkedIn, and Indeed to identify gaps and opportunities tailored to the alumni community. Based on these insights, I developed detailed user scenarios and journey maps, ensuring the app’s features aligned with real-world use cases. Finally, I translated these findings into low-fidelity wireframes, iterating on the design to create an intuitive, functional, and user-focused experience.</p>
                    <h5 class="subheading">Research</h5>
                    <p class="paragraph">I began with an in-depth field study, interacting directly with alumni from MESCE to understand their needs, pain points, and expectations from a platform like this. This involved gathering insights about job hunting struggles, the need for an exclusive network, and the importance of a reliable blood donor listing within the alumni community.</p>
                    <h5 class="subheading">Stakeholder Interviews</h5>
                    <p class="paragraph">I conducted interviews with key stakeholders  including alumni association members, faculty coordinators, and students  to align the app's objectives with the college’s vision. These discussions provided valuable insights into what features would be most beneficial and how the app could sustain long-term engagement among the alumni.</p>
                    <h5 class="subheading">Secondary Research</h5>
                    <p class="paragraph">I analyzed existing platforms like Naukrigulf, LinkedIn, and Indeed to understand their strengths and limitations. This helped identify gaps in functionality particularly the lack of a personalized, alumni-specific space and shaped features that would make the MESCE UAE Alumni app stand out, such as localized job filters, community-driven job postings, and the integrated blood donor network.</p>
                    <h5 class="subheading">User Scenario Development</h5>
                    <p class="paragraph">Based on the research, I created detailed user scenarios that mapped out how different types of alumni  from fresh graduates to experienced professionals would interact with the app. This helped visualize various contexts, like an alumnus urgently seeking a job, another wanting to hire from their alumni network, or someone needing a blood donor in an emergency. Each scenario informed design decisions to ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience.</p>
                    <h5 class="subheading">Prototyping</h5>
                    <p class="paragraph">Using insights from user journeys and scenarios, I created low-fidelity wireframes to outline the app’s structure and flow. The focus was on simplifying complex tasks  like job filtering or searching for a donor  into quick, accessible steps. These prototypes were iterated upon after user feedback, ensuring the final version was aligned with user behavior and expectations.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The next phase followed the LEAN UX Method focusing on Think, Make, Check. I began with the Think stage, defining hypotheses based on user research and stakeholder insights. In the Make stage, I translated these ideas into low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes, ensuring quick, iterative design. Finally, the Check phase involved gathering user feedback, testing the prototypes, and refining the design to ensure it met alumni needs effectively.</p>

                    <h5 class="subheading">Make</h5>
                    <p class="paragraph">In the Make phase, I transformed ideas into action by creating sketches, wireframes, and the initial UI design. I collaborated with stakeholders to review the designs, gathering feedback to refine navigation flows and make necessary design adjustments, ensuring the app stayed intuitive and aligned with user expectations.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">In the Check phase, I presented the prototype to users and stakeholders, gathering valuable feedback. I conducted usability testing to identify pain points and areas for improvement, then refined the design to ensure the final experience was smooth, functional, and aligned with the alumni's needs.</p>
