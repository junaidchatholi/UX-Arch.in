                    <p class="paragraph">Quick Supermarket is a mobile e-commerce application developed for a real supermarket chain aiming to enhance the in-store shopping experience with a digital touch. The key feature of the app, called Live Shopping, allows users to scan products while physically shopping in the supermarket and add them to a virtual cart for later purchase.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">For this project, I followed the Lean UX methodology to ensure fast, collaborative, and user-centered design decisions. Rather than waiting to deliver a fully polished product, Lean UX allowed me to work in rapid, iterative cycles — starting with assumptions, forming hypotheses, and testing with real users early and often. This approach was especially effective for validating the Live Shopping feature, as it involved real-world interactions in a supermarket environment. Through continuous collaboration with the client and development team, and by focusing on fast feedback loops, I was able to adapt designs quickly and deliver a solution that genuinely addressed both user needs and business objectives.</p>
